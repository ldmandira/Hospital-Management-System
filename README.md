# Hospital-Management-System

This software is designed to manage hospitals that are dedicated to providing better health care to the people. The hospital management system includes many functions such as registering patients and storing their information in the system.The main objective of our project is to create a paperless hospital system. It also aims to standardize data, ensure data integrity and minimize inconsistencies.


My part is to create All employee, Edit employee and Employee detail pages.
